							<p>was compared with an hallucinosis; for centuries this was a great mythic theme. But today it is as if we repressed the profound madness of Photography: it reminds us of its mythic heritage only by that faint uneasiness which seizes me when I look at "myself" on a piece of paper.
                <br>This disturbance is ultimately one of ownership. Law has expressed it in its way: to whom does the photograph belong? Is landscape itself only a kind of loan made by the owner of the terrain? Countless cases, apparently, have expressed this uncertainty in a society for which being was based on having. Photography transformed subject into object, and even, one might say, into a museum object: <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" data-html="true" placement="auto" title="In order to take the first portraits..." data-content="<a href='../images/pic01.jpg' target='_blank'><img src='../images/pic01.jpg' width='100%'/></a><p>Here is some text about this thing</p><p>Another paragraph can go here, and <a href='http://haverford.edu' target='_blank'>link</a> to things.</p>">in order to take the first portraits (around 1840) the subject had to assume long poses under a glass roof in bright sunlight; to become an object made one suffer as much as a surgical operation</a>; then a device was invented, <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" data-html="true" placement="auto" title="A kind of prosthesis" data-content="<a href='../images/pic01.jpg' target='_blank'><img src='../images/pic01.jpg' width='100%'/></a><p>Here is some text about this thing</p><p>Another paragraph can go here, and <a href='http://haverford.edu' target='_blank'>link</a> to things.</p>">a kind of prosthesis invisible to the lens, which supported and maintained the body in its passage to immobility: this headrest was the pedestal of the statue I would become</a>, the corset of my imaginary essence.
                <br>The portrait-photograph is a closed field of forces. Four image-repertoires intersect here, oppose and distort each other. In front of the lens, I am at the same time: the one I think I am, the one I want others to think I am, the one the photographer thinks I am, and the one he makes use of to exhibit his art. In other words, a strange action: I do not stop imitating myself, and because of this, each time I am (or let myself be) photographed, I invariably suffer from a sensation of inauthenticity, sometimes of imposture   (comparable to certain nightmares).
